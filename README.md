#### Back to the future: origins and directions of the “Agile Manifesto” – views of the originators

https://jserd.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40411-018-0059-z#Sec1

This article talked about the Agile Manifesto and conducted interviews to its originators about how previous practices and development methods led up to the creation of their manifesto, what they think about the manifesto now and how it's being implemented, and what they think the future lies with the Agile Manifesto. 

What I found a bit interesting about this article was how some of the originators explained why the agile manifesto is being implemented incorrectly and that companies are trying to _do_ Agile without actually _being_ Agile. What I didn't really know before is that before the manifesto became popular, management used to be separate from the developers. Now it's become a "management approach" where management, including higher management who have no idea what Agile really is, are becoming more intrusive among developers, according to Ron Jeffries, one of the originators for the manifesto. So it seems like the manifesto is giving more pressure to developers to make working software, instead of making their world safer. However, the originators still feel like the manifesto's ideas should still stay for now since there aren't better approaches to development. But they were divided on how they would approach the manifesto in the future. Some believe a revision of the manifesto could be a possibility and some want to adapt it to different fields of work outside of software development. One originator interestingly said that there's no point in updating it because of how misused it is. It's interesting as it seems like this originator does not have faith that companies would follow agile correctly, even with revisions. So overall, this article surprised me about how the manifesto is actually making the lives of developers worse, at least how the originators are implying it with companies' poor implementation of the manifesto.

I find the line about making software a higher priority than making the world safer very interesting, and it goes to show how easily we can be blinded by our means to an end instead of remembering the goal we set for ourselves in the first place
